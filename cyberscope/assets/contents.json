        "body":"(\\ \n\\'\\ \n \\'\\     __________  \n / '|   ()_________)\n \\ '/    \\ ~~~~~~~~ \\\n   \\       \\ ~~~~~~   \\\n   ==).      \\__________\\\n  (__)       ()__________)\n\n---== The Questions ==--\n\nWhat is the actual origin of the Hoarding behaviour? Is it the instinct? Bare survival trait gone mad? Or is there much more to it?\n\n---== The qualities ==-- If we begin defining hoarding as piling up of 'items', we definitely need to qualify it further because not every child creating a pile of marbles is actually hoarding.\n\nPiling up, warehousing, gathering would need to be mostly semi-aware. The mechanical process, the act of taking, bringing, laying down can be totally automatic or can have a certain fanatical, zealot-like quality to it. But even more importantly the reason behind the action, behind all of it is at least semi-awareness of the purpose. If we think upon it, we will encounter almost meme-like rationalizations 'you never know when will it come handy' and 'the best things in life are free'.\n\nSo no clear reason is present. Only vague possible future use Sense of false security and even future thrill of had being abl to anticipate the need. The quality of future thrill is really interesting - it is in between the victory of 'I told You so and almost occult shade of bidirectional awareness of full deja vu.\n\nStability and security in the abundance sounds also quite explanator but what does the plethora of even normally usable items really provide to the Hoarder? What is the point of having 20 pieces of for example, cooking pans? Especially if you do not have mor than one stove. Double so if you don't cook at all.\n\nThere is a joy in improvisation, I'll give you that Utilizing something in the way nobody dreamt of can make You fee smart, exhilarated and even child-like victorious beyond any rational explanation. But hoarding usually does NOT contain any actual usage!\n\n---== The realms of Hoarding ==-- Into the realms Understanding Transcendence of hoarding into the digital realm requires at least some experience with the evolution of the digital Certain degree of observative awareness of the world, of immediat and not so immediate environment during time.\n\nI'll relate to my own experiences as they would be truest - in th sense of the 'fullestness' of the complexity, not of impartial objectivity.\n\nChild always wants new. Not necessarily because it is tired of what it already has. Child wants to be AMAZED. And the amazement tend to phase away, to slip, to drip away and meander beyond the fingers out of the reach. Grasping to keep the amazement is futile, so graspin to get more, additional amazements, to keep being amazed irrespectabl even of the sources can become a solid motivation although we can argue that it is almost an instinct. Not really a part of the surviva instinct as much as a part of the 'inspirational' instinct.\n\nLet's leave here a note for the future dwellings of the mindful ones inspirational instinct or tendency, need for amazement seems like a quite valid source for the initiation of and perseverance on the quest for beauty, for moments captured in the landscapes, tastes, scents, delicacy of touch, mental conquests for explanations of physical an metaphysical beyond Us, plain joy of movement, dancing, holding still powerful tiredness of the muscles, explosiveness and implosiveness of sex, pervasiveness of love and care.\n\nBut let's not get carried away (yet!) There were toys. Physical objects to play with, always more others than\navailable ones. But there was peace in playing with what you had Improvising, IMAGINING. With any luck, improvising and imagining TOGETHER Only break in that peace would occur when glimpse of some new toy would  appear, parading in front of me - initiating the avalanche of amazement imaginary story-lines and desire to use, to play, to combine But then... those breaks kept coming. In those olden days of yore when we had only TWO tv channels, the third one brought more cartoons, more advertisements with more toys that you can think of Luckily, and I can say 'luckily' only now as Me at that time wouldn't agree the financial reasons kept at bay basic hoarding habits.\n\nSoon though, there would be no defense against another attack Video clubs  brought the tide of movies. Good, bad, it didn't matter really Consumption lead to owning. Owning introduced hoarding.\n\nHoarding as a chaotic sibling of the collecting. Where collecting mean meticulous, careful, systematic , hoarding meant brute, voracious, berserk As in DnD, without going into the good vs evil, it now can be compared to the lawful vs chaotic. At least partially.\n\nToo many VHS tapes. Less than one tenth personal ones. The others just claiming to be there for our repeatable enjoyment. But I can tell you now that less than 5 percent of them have been watched more than once Intruders of our home, false kings that we somehow always wanted more of.\n\nThere were other 'strains' Computer games have been fabulous from the moment I laid my eyes on the ZX Spectrum. Full swing of the hoarding pendulum came with sharing Amiga games Parallel to them, the book passion exploded and literally created a maze a dungeon out of my room and later whole of the apartment.\n\nAlthough to be completely honest, these strains carried the seed of hoarding They were not true hoaring strains because their 'items' were used really utilised. They kept the seed alive although half-dormant  The brightest example of the digital hoarding so far in my experienc have been MP3 files. So many, oh my... So many days spent getting them always new ones, always better quality, stopped caring about genre, year just trying to mask berserkhood of it all with half-baked attempts of cataloguing them Modems buzzing in the dark hours, improving internet package, getting empty CDs, creating compilations, burning for the friends, crafting wrapping covers, getting larger HDDs... But listening  to only 5% of it all more then once. Some of it not even once So little time for the true amazement. \n\nTo realize that you have exchanged true amazement with a possibility for 'incredible quantity' of future amazements. Amazes me still, the auto-seduction\nof it all.\n\nDigital evolution just made it easier to magnify your traits.\n\nAnother note to avid explorers: just like the legends of vampirism see  to claim that vampirism is making person more of what he really was  digitalism seems to fulfill the same rol  It was easier to get more, more, more. Mostly media. Movies, songs, books Seldom was there WHY. \n\n ---== The Trans and the Meta ==-- The Hoarding story seems to run deeply within emotional, psychological shell The instinct-animal is a good part of it So the ascending must also then be a part of it Religious tenets of not holding on to the physical (and virtual!), of letting go of setting love and loved ones free and most of all of awareness, self-awarenes are really imperative. For understanding, for choosing, for riding the personal quantum wave that each of us is.\n\nFor the socially attracted, let there be a way of sharing, communicatin akin to the French revolution. Let the Liberte be entwined with Fraternite may we find freedom in the sharing with the siblings not only in Egalite wa but in a way that some may be amazed with what others do not see at all Do not turn sharing with overload. No news, no information manufacturing Quality, not quantity now.\n\nFor the involuntarily economically challenged - praise the limits of choices Raise above it, but ascend. Aware, amazed, not automated, not because of the idols The traps abound, many paths lead down. Even choices lead down. Understanding the Meta brings choice which is anti-hoarding Do not be Industry, but be industrious In the realm of digital, throw the garbage Eutanize those tabs! Shred the emails! Keep the memory, not the backups Digital measure for digital age :)  "
