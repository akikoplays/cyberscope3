# cyberscope3

A composite repository containing several hobby projects. 

* cyberscope - Almagest Cyberscope volume 3, it's a pure js, phaser2 playground for building an online disk-mag, the old way, WIP, one day we'll release it
* streamerizer - rpi streamer service, both local or network streaming, based on gstreamer. Comes with additional tools for anim gif -> avi batch conversion and minimal http server for controlling the service
* modsucker - simple python wget wrapper (I created it as a downloader for mod files I was too lazy to download manually)
* chip-streamer - an emulator I wrote for a project I was working on, because the HW was late I improvised usign Nextthing C.H.I.P. and linux. A lot of interesting things how to set up and use gstreamer on CHIP, how to make your simple HTTP server that controls video playback, how to setup CHIP system services
* ceopunisher - playground for making oldschool beat em up using phaser / js - a good starting point, but requires a lot of cleanup
